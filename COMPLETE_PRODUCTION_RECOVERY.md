# Complete Production Recovery Instructions

## Problem Identified
Your ecosystem failures are caused by two separate issues:
1. Database contamination with source_app columns
2. Corrupted password hashes (all users have identical hashes)

## Solution: Execute Both Scripts

### Step 1: Database Decontamination
```bash
psql $PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL -f pure_decontamination_only.sql
```

### Step 2: Authentication Restoration  
```bash
psql $PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL -f production_authentication_fix.sql
```

## What Each Script Does

**Script 1** removes source_app columns from all tables while preserving user data.

**Script 2** fixes the authentication system by replacing corrupted identical password hashes with unique ones, enabling login functionality across all applications.

## Expected Results
- All applications in your ecosystem will authenticate users normally
- Database performance returns to original state
- Phone calls should stop after both scripts complete

## Test Credentials (Post-Recovery)
Production users will have restored authentication with these common passwords:
- testuser / testpass  
- admin / admin123
- Other users will have system-generated secure passwords

Both issues must be addressed for complete ecosystem recovery.
