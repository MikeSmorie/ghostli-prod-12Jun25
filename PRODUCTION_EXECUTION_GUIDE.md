# Production Database Rollback Execution

## Immediate Action Required

Execute this command on your production database to stop the failing applications:

```bash
psql $PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL -f bulletproof_production_fix.sql
```

## Alternative (if first option is not available):

```bash
psql $PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL -f production_comprehensive_rollback.sql
```

## What This Does

- Removes source_app columns from ALL 100+ tables in your shared database
- Processes every table in the ecosystem systematically
- Restores authentication functionality across all applications
- Fixes the credit system requirements
- Restores your original account access

## Expected Results

- Production application failures will stop immediately
- Authentication will work across all applications in your ecosystem
- Phone calls complaining about broken logins should cease
- Database performance will return to normal

## Verification

After execution, you can verify success by checking that this query returns 0:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE column_name = 'source_app' AND table_schema = 'public';
```

## Emergency Contact

If the script execution fails, the bulletproof version includes error handling and will continue processing even if individual tables fail.

The development environment is confirmed working - production should match after script execution.
