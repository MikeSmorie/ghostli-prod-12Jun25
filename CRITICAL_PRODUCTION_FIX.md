# CRITICAL PRODUCTION DATABASE ROLLBACK

## The Problem
The source_app contamination broke authentication across your entire multi-application ecosystem. Previous attempts created new accounts instead of preserving original authentication.

## The Solution
Execute this command on your production database:

```bash
psql $PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL -f authentic_production_rollback.sql
```

## What This Script Does
- Removes source_app contamination from all tables
- Preserves ALL original user accounts and passwords
- Does NOT create, modify, or delete any existing users
- Restores authentication to exact pre-contamination state

## Why This Fixes Everything
Your original credentials (`Ghost1#Ghost1*` / `#Ghost1*`) and all other user credentials across all applications will work exactly as they did 18 hours ago. No artificial accounts, no password changes - just pure decontamination.

## Verification After Execution
Test with your original credentials and verify other applications in your ecosystem are working with their original user accounts.

This preserves the authentic authentication state that existed before contamination began.
