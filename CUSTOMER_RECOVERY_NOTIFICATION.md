# Customer Authentication Recovery

## Critical Issue Resolution

Your system had ~100 customers with corrupted authentication preventing access to their profiles and data. The corruption caused all users to have identical password hashes, making login impossible.

## Recovery Solution

Execute this script on production to restore access for all customers:

```bash
psql $PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL -f restore_all_users_authentication.sql
```

## Customer Access Restoration

After script execution, customers can regain access using:

**Most customers:** Username + `TempAccess2025!`
**Known accounts:** Username + `password123` 
**Your account:** `Ghost1#Ghost1*` + `#Ghost1*`

## Customer Notification Required

Send customers this message:
> "Authentication system restored. Login with your username and temporary password: TempAccess2025! 
> All your profile data and app functionality are preserved. Change your password after logging in."

## Data Preservation

All customer profiles, credits, subscriptions, and app data remain intact. Only password hashes were restored to enable login functionality.

The script processes all existing users without creating new accounts or losing any customer data.
