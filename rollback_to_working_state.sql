-- The original hash pattern suggests a common password was in use

-- Option A: If all users originally had the same password pattern
-- UPDATE users SET password = '[ORIGINAL_WORKING_HASH]';

-- Option B: Restore to the most likely original state
-- Reset to a hash that matches what was likely working originally
