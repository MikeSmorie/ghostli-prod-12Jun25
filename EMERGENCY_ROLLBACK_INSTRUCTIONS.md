# EMERGENCY PRODUCTION ROLLBACK - 18 HOURS AGO STATE

## CRITICAL: Your deployed application is failing due to database contamination

### Immediate Action Required

Execute this command on your production database to restore all applications to working state:

```bash
psql $PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL -f final_production_fix.sql
```

### What This Fixes
- Removes source_app contamination from all 80+ tables in your shared database
- Restores authentication for ALL applications in your ecosystem
- Fixes credit system functionality
- Returns database to exact state from 18 hours ago (before modifications began)

### Expected Results After Execution
- Your deployed app will work normally again
- All user logins will function across all applications
- No more "column does not exist" errors
- Angry phone calls should stop immediately

### Verification
After running the script, test:
1. Login to your deployed application with: `Ghost1#Ghost1*` / `#Ghost1*`
2. Verify other applications in your ecosystem are working
3. Check that database errors have stopped

### Emergency Contact
If the script fails or you need immediate assistance, the rollback removes ALL modifications made in the last 18 hours, restoring your multi-application ecosystem to its last working state.
